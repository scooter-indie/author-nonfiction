# AI-Assisted Nonfiction Authoring Framework - Development Repository

**Framework Version:** 0.15.1
**Repository:** https://github.com/scooter-indie/author-nonfiction (development)
**Distribution:** https://github.com/scooter-indie/author-nonfiction-dist (user releases)

## FIRST ACTION - Read Anti-Hallucination Guidelines

**At session startup, immediately read:** `Process/Anti-Hallucination_Guidelines.md`

This is mandatory before any other work.

---

## GitHub Workflow (MANDATORY)

**Triggers - Create issue IMMEDIATELY, then WAIT:**
- "finding:" / "bug:" / "issue:" → Create issue with `finding` label
- "enhancement:" / "can you add" → Create issue with `enhancement` label
- "proposal:" → Create Proposal/ doc + issue

**Flow:** Create issue → WAIT for "work on it" → Fix → Commit with #issue → WAIT for "Done" → Close

**Never** fix bugs without creating an issue first.

See `/gh-workflow` for detailed procedures.
