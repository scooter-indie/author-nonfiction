### Development Workflow

**Making Changes:**
1. Clone this repository
2. Make changes to framework files
3. Update version in `Process/AI-Assisted_Nonfiction_Authoring_Process.md`
4. Document changes in `Process/AI-Assisted_Nonfiction_Authoring_Process_chg.md`
5. Commit and push to main branch

**Creating a Release:**
1. Ensure all changes are committed and pushed
2. Run `Process/Prompts/Prompt_99_Build_Release.md` in Claude Code
3. This will:
   - Create production zip (excludes `_chg` files, `Proposal/`, etc.)
   - Generate `installer.md` with embedded version
   - Create `README.md` for book authors
   - Create `.nonfiction-manifest.json`
   - Tag the release in git
   - Publish GitHub Release with assets

**Testing:**
1. Download the release assets from GitHub
2. Test installation in a clean directory
3. Verify all prompts work correctly
4. Check documentation accuracy

### Key Principles

**For Authors:**
- Simple download and install (no git clone)
- Conversational prompts (no complex syntax)
- Auto-commit to git (safety by default)
- Change tracking with rationale
- Style-aware AI assistance

**For Developers:**
- Use `_chg.md` files for framework development
- Excluded from production builds
- Semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch)
- Comprehensive version history
- Clear separation: framework vs. book content

### Contributing

**Areas for Contribution:**
- Additional curated writing styles
- New prompt features
- Documentation improvements
- Bug fixes
- Template enhancements

**Process:**
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly
5. Submit pull request with clear description

### File Naming Conventions

**Framework Development:**
- `*_chg.md` - Change tracking files (excluded from production)
- `*_template.md` - Templates for generated files
- `Prompt_N_*.md` - Execute prompts (1-10 for users, 99 for build)

**Production Distribution:**
- No `_chg.md` files
- `README.md` is author-focused
- `README_FRAMEWORK.md` for developers (not in production)
