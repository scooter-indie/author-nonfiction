## What This Does

I will help you create a new nonfiction book project from scratch, including:
- Complete directory structure
- Git repository initialization
- Configuration files
- Table of contents
- Chapter placeholders with change tracking files
- Front and back matter placeholders

---

## How This Works

I'll ask you a series of questions to gather the information needed to set up your project. You can provide a path to an existing TOC file, or I'll help you create one interactively.

**Questions I'll ask:**

1. What is the working title of your book?
2. What is your name (author)?
3. What is the target total word count?
4. Who is the target audience?
5. What is the book's purpose or main thesis?
6. What is your target completion date?
7. Do you have an existing TOC file? (If yes, provide path)
8. If no TOC file: How many chapters and what are their topics/titles?

**Then I'll:**

1. Parse existing TOC (if provided) or create from your input
2. Create complete directory structure
3. Initialize git repository
4. Generate configuration files (Project_Config.md, Project_Metadata.md, USAGE_GUIDE.md)
5. Create TOC/TOC.md and TOC/TOC_chg.md
6. Generate chapter placeholder files with _chg files
7. Create front matter and back matter placeholders
8. Commit everything to git with appropriate messages
9. Tag as v1.0.0
10. Provide confirmation report
