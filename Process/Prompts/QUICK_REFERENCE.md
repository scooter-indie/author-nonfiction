# Quick Reference Guide - Execute Prompts

## Claude Desktop vs. Claude Code CLI Compatibility

### DESKTOP-READY (100% Claude Desktop - No CLI needed)
- ✅ **Prompt 6** - Consistency checks (read-only analysis)

### DESKTOP-FRIENDLY (95%+ Desktop - Single git command at end)
- ✅ **Prompt 2** - Add new chapter
- ✅ **Prompt 3** - Modify file (PRIMARY WORKFLOW)
- ✅ **Prompt 4** - Integrate Inbox content
- ✅ **Prompt 8** - Progress dashboard
- ✅ **Prompt 10** - Update change tracking

### HYBRID (50-80% Desktop - Multiple CLI interactions)
- ⚡ **Prompt 1** - Initialize project (file creation in Desktop, git via CLI throughout)

### CLI-ONLY (Must use Claude Code CLI)
- 🔧 **Prompt 5** - Compile manuscript (bulk file operations)
- 🔧 **Prompt 7** - Export to DOCX/PDF/EPUB (requires pandoc)
- 🔧 **Prompt 9** - Git operations (direct git commands)

**Notes:**
- **DESKTOP-FRIENDLY** prompts work in Claude Desktop, provide single git command at end
- **HYBRID** prompts work in both environments with multiple back-and-forth interactions
- **CLI-ONLY** prompts must be run entirely in Claude Code CLI

## The Primary Workflow: Prompt 3

**This is how you'll spend 80% of your time revising content.**

### Step-by-Step

1. **Identify what needs changing**
   - You review your content
   - You decide what to revise

2. **Write instructions in _chg file**
   ```
   Open: Manuscript/Chapters/Chapter_05/Chapter_05_Analysis_chg.md

   Find: ## REWRITE INSTRUCTIONS
         ### [INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS REVISION]

   Write: Rewrite section 2 ("Data Analysis Methods") to:
          - Add example using the survey data
          - Clarify the statistical approach
          - Add reference to Smith (2024) paper
          - Improve transitions between paragraphs

          Priority: High
          Rationale: Current explanation is too abstract
   ```

3. **Commit the _chg file**
   ```
   git add Manuscript/Chapters/Chapter_05/Chapter_05_Analysis_chg.md
   git commit -m "Add revision instructions for Chapter 5"
   ```

4. **Execute Prompt 3**
   ```
   Copy: Process/Prompts/Prompt_3_Modify_File.md
   Paste into Claude Code

   AI asks: "Which file should I modify?"
   You: "Manuscript/Chapters/Chapter_05/Chapter_05_Analysis.md"

   AI asks: "Should I analyze content first?"
   You: "Yes" or "No"

   AI: [Reads _chg file, confirms changes, executes]
   ```

5. **AI Auto-Completes**
   - Applies your instructions
   - Moves instructions to Version History
   - Clears [INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS REVISION]
   - Updates metadata (word count, date)
   - Creates git commit
   - Reports results

6. **Result**
   - Chapter is revised
   - _chg file has new Version History entry
   - Instructions section is ready for next revision
   - Git has commit record

### Why This Works

✅ **Single source of truth**: Instructions in _chg file
✅ **Version tracked**: Instructions committed to git
✅ **Auditable**: Version History shows all changes
✅ **Repeatable**: Can iterate quickly
✅ **Clean**: Instructions auto-archived, ready for next

## Prompt Chaining

Some tasks naturally chain prompts:

### Add Chapter → Modify Content
```
1. Prompt 2 (Add Chapter) - Creates placeholder
2. Prompt 3 (Modify File) - Fill in content
```

### Integrate → Consistency → Fix
```
1. Prompt 4 (Integrate Inbox) - Add new content
2. Prompt 6 (Consistency) - Check for issues
3. Prompt 3 (Modify File) - Fix issues found
```

### Dashboard → Consistency → Compile
```
1. Prompt 8 (Dashboard) - Check status
2. Prompt 6 (Consistency) - Full check
3. Prompt 5 (Compile) - If ready, compile
```

---

## Quick Decision Tree

**"What prompt do I need?"**

```
Do you have a project yet?
├─ No → Prompt 1 (Initialize)
└─ Yes ↓

What do you want to do?

## Tips for Success

### For Prompt 3 (Your Main Tool)
1. **Be specific in _chg instructions**: More detail = better results
2. **Commit _chg before executing**: Creates audit trail
3. **One focus per revision**: Don't try to fix everything at once
4. **Use Priority markers**: High/Medium/Low helps AI understand urgency

### For All Prompts
1. **Read the Anti-Hallucination Guidelines**: Prevents fabricated content
2. **Push to remote daily**: Cloud backup via Prompt 9
3. **Run Prompt 8 weekly**: Stay aware of progress
4. **Run Prompt 6 before compiling**: Catch issues before full review
5. **Use default settings**: Stored in Project_Config.md, save time

### TOC Management
1. **Never edit TOC_chg.md manually**: AI-managed only
2. **Use Prompt 2 for new chapters**: Keeps TOC in sync
3. **No complete TOC files in Inbox after init**: Use Prompt 2 instead

## Example Instructions for _chg Files

### Good Examples

```markdown
### [INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS REVISION]

Strengthen the opening paragraph:
- Start with the surprising statistic about remote work adoption
- Add emotional hook about changed workplace expectations
- Connect to reader's likely experience
- Lead into the chapter's main argument

Priority: High
Rationale: Current opening is weak, doesn't engage reader
```

```markdown
### [INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS REVISION]

Add case study to section 3:
- Use the TechCorp example (fictional but realistic)
- Show how they implemented 4-day work week
- Include challenges and results
- Keep it brief (300-400 words)
- Add [CITATION NEEDED] marker for real-world similar case

Priority: Medium
Rationale: Section needs concrete example to illustrate points
```

### Less Effective

```markdown
### [INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS REVISION]

Make it better
```
*Too vague - AI needs specific guidance*

```markdown
### [INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS REVISION]

Rewrite everything and add 10 examples and fix all the problems
```
*Too broad - break into smaller, focused revisions*

## Getting Unstuck

**Problem**: Not sure which prompt to use
**Solution**: Check the decision tree above or start with Prompt 8 (Dashboard)

**Problem**: Prompt 3 isn't understanding my instructions
**Solution**: Be more specific in _chg file, use examples

**Problem**: Too many issues from Prompt 6
**Solution**: Tackle high-priority first, use Prompt 3 iteratively

**Problem**: Forgot to commit _chg file
**Solution**: Commit it now, re-run Prompt 3

**Problem**: Lost track of progress
**Solution**: Prompt 8 (Dashboard) shows everything

---

## Remember

**The core loop is simple:**
1. Write instructions in _chg file
2. Commit _chg file
3. Execute Prompt 3
4. AI applies, archives, commits
5. Repeat

Everything else supports this core workflow.
