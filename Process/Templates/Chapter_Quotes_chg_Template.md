**[USAGE NOTE]**

This file tracks the evolution of chapter quotes but doesn't use the full REWRITE INSTRUCTIONS workflow since quotes are edited directly in Chapter_Quotes.md. This file is primarily for:
- Tracking which quotes changed and why
- Recording verification progress
- Noting issues or concerns about specific quotes
- Documenting permission/copyright status
