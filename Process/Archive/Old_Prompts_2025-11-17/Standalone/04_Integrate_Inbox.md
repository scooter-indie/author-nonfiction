# Prompt 4: Integrate New Content from Inbox

## Instructions to AI Assistant

**BEFORE PROCEEDING:** Read and apply the guidelines in `Process/Anti-Hallucination_Guidelines.md` throughout this entire process.

Execute Prompt 4 from the AI-Assisted Nonfiction Authoring Process (v3.0.0) to process files in the Inbox directory and integrate them into the appropriate locations.

## Task

Process all files currently in the `Inbox/` directory and integrate them into the book project.

## Expected Actions

Please follow the complete Prompt 4 workflow:

1. **Scan Inbox**: List and analyze all files in Inbox/
2. **Identify File Types**:
   - TOC/Outline files (priority handling)
   - Regular content files
   - Reference materials
   - Assets

3. **Special TOC Handling** (if applicable):
   - Parse TOC content flexibly
   - Extract structure and metadata
   - Present merge vs. replace options
   - Execute user's chosen integration strategy

4. **Regular Content Analysis**: Suggest integration points for non-TOC files

5. **User Decision**: Get confirmation for destination and integration method

6. **Pre-Integration Git State**: Commit current changes

7. **Integration**: Execute chosen integration option (new chapter, insert, update, or move to research)

8. **Update References**: Add bibliography entries, cross-references, assets

9. **Version Control**: Update change tracking files and create git commits

10. **Clean Inbox**: Archive processed files to `Inbox/Processed_[date]/`

11. **Generate Report**: Summary of actions and git log

## Integration Guidance

- **For TOC files**: I will present options to merge or replace existing TOC
- **For content files**: I will suggest the most appropriate location
- **For assets**: I will organize into appropriate Assets/ subdirectories
- **For references**: I will suggest Bibliography or Research/ placement

## Output Expected

1. Analysis of all Inbox files
2. Recommendations for each file
3. Interactive decision prompts
4. Executed integrations
5. Git commits for all changes
6. Integration report with git log
7. Clean Inbox directory
