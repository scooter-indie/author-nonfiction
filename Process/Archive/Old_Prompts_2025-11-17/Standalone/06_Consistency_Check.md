# Prompt 6: Consistency Checker

## Instructions to AI Assistant

**BEFORE PROCEEDING:** Read and apply the guidelines in `Process/Anti-Hallucination_Guidelines.md` throughout this entire process.

Execute Prompt 6 from the AI-Assisted Nonfiction Authoring Process (v3.0.0) to scan all content for consistency issues and potential problems.

## Task

Perform a comprehensive consistency check across the book project.

## Scope

Check **all chapters and supporting content** for:

1. **Terminology Consistency**
   - Build terminology index
   - Flag variations (e.g., "email" vs. "e-mail")
   - Check capitalization consistency
   - Identify acronym usage patterns

2. **Cross-Reference Validation**
   - List all internal references
   - Verify targets exist
   - Check for broken links
   - Flag ambiguous references

3. **Style Consistency**
   - Heading hierarchy
   - List formatting
   - Quote style
   - Number formatting
   - Date formatting

4. **Fact Consistency**
   - Track claims made across chapters
   - Flag contradictions
   - Note statistics used multiple times
   - Verify consistent citations

5. **Tone/Voice Analysis**
   - Assess formality level consistency
   - Check person perspective (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
   - Note tense consistency
   - Identify outlier sections

## Expected Output

Generate a comprehensive report including:

1. **Critical Issues**: Problems that must be fixed
2. **Warnings**: Items that should be reviewed
3. **Suggestions**: Improvements to consider
4. **Terminology Index**: Terms and their usage patterns
5. **Cross-Reference Map**: All internal references and their validity

## Report Format

Please organize the report by:
- Priority (Critical → High → Medium → Low)
- Location (Chapter/file where issue occurs)
- Type (Terminology, Cross-reference, Style, Fact, Tone)
